Tap code is a way to communicate using a series of taps and pauses for each letter. In this kata, we will use dots . for the taps and whitespaces for the pauses.

The number of taps needed for each letter matches its coordinates in the following polybius square (note the c/k position). Then you "tap" the row, a pause, then the column. Each letter is separated from others with a pause too.
